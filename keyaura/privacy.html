Privacy Policy for KeyAura
Effective Date: January 19, 2026

KeyAura ("we," "our," or "the App") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information when you use our macOS application.

1. Our Core Privacy Principle: 100% Local Storage
Your privacy is our highest priority. Unlike many other applications, KeyAura does not collect, transmit, or store any of your keystroke data on any external servers. All data processed by the App is stored exclusively on your local Mac. We have no access to your data, and we cannot see what you type or which keys you use.

2. Information Collection and Use
A. Keystroke Frequency Data
KeyAura tracks the frequency of keystrokes to generate heatmaps and productivity statistics.

Local Processing: This data is processed and stored locally in a secure sandbox on your device.

No Content Logging: The App is designed to count how many times a key is pressed, not the order of keys or the specific text being typed. We do not record passwords, messages, or sensitive information.

B. App Store Transactions
If you purchase KeyAura Pro, the transaction is handled entirely by Apple through StoreKit 2. We do not collect or store your credit card information or personal billing details. Apple provides us with anonymous transaction receipts to verify your Pro status.

C. AI Insights (Optional)
If you opt-in to our AI Insight features, any analysis is performed using local algorithms or secure, ephemeral processing where data is not retained. At no point is your raw keystroke history shared with third-party AI providers for training purposes.

3. System Permissions
To function correctly, KeyAura requires Accessibility (Input Monitoring) permissions from macOS. This permission is used solely to detect when a key is pressed so that the App can increment the frequency count for the corresponding key. It is never used to monitor your private communications.

4. Data Security
Because all data remains on your local machine, the security of your data is protected by your Mac’s system-level encryption (such as FileVault). We recommend keeping your macOS updated to ensure the highest level of security for your local files.

5. Third-Party Services
KeyAura does not include third-party analytics (like Google Analytics or Facebook SDK) or advertising frameworks. We believe in a clean, tracker-free experience.

6. Children’s Privacy
Our App does not collect any personal information from anyone, including children under the age of 13. Since no data is transmitted to us, we are fully compliant with COPPA and global privacy standards.

7. Changes to This Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Effective Date" at the top.
